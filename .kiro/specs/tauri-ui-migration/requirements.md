# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing Tauri backend functionality to integrate seamlessly with the new Next.js UI framework for imgtoss, a cross-platform application for automated image uploading to object storage services. The migration will ensure that all existing Tauri services (OSS integration, file processing, history management, and configuration) work properly with the new React-based frontend while maintaining the application's core functionality of supporting multiple cloud storage providers (Alibaba Cloud OSS, Tencent Cloud COS, Amazon S3) and two primary upload modes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate existing Tauri backend services with the new Next.js frontend, so that all current functionality remains available through the modern UI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize all existing Tauri services (config, file, history, image, OSS services)
2. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN the system SHALL route requests to appropriate Tauri command handlers
3. WHEN Tauri commands are invoked THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted responses compatible with the React frontend
4. IF a Tauri service fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the frontend

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure multiple object storage providers through the new UI, so that I can manage my cloud storage settings easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the storage configuration page THEN the system SHALL display all supported storage providers (OSS, COS, S3)
2. WHEN I add a new storage configuration THEN the system SHALL validate the credentials and save them locally
3. WHEN I modify existing storage settings THEN the system SHALL update the configuration and test connectivity
4. WHEN I export configuration THEN the system SHALL generate a downloadable configuration file
5. WHEN I import configuration THEN the system SHALL validate and apply the imported settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload markdown files and automatically process local images, so that I can convert local image references to cloud storage URLs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a markdown file THEN the system SHALL parse and identify all local image references
2. WHEN local images are detected THEN the system SHALL display a list of images for user selection
3. WHEN I choose images to upload THEN the system SHALL upload selected images to the configured storage provider
4. WHEN upload completes THEN the system SHALL automatically replace local image paths with cloud URLs in the markdown file
5. WHEN the process finishes THEN the system SHALL save the operation to history records

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload multiple images directly through the new UI, so that I can batch upload photos and get shareable links.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the image upload page THEN the system SHALL provide drag-and-drop and file selection interfaces
2. WHEN I select multiple images THEN the system SHALL display upload progress for each file
3. WHEN images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL generate shareable links for each image
4. WHEN upload completes THEN the system SHALL provide quick copy functionality for all generated links
5. WHEN the operation finishes THEN the system SHALL save all uploaded images to history records

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and manage my upload history through the new UI, so that I can track and reuse previously uploaded images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the history page THEN the system SHALL display all previously uploaded images with metadata
2. WHEN I view history records THEN the system SHALL show image thumbnails, upload dates, and storage locations
3. WHEN I click on an image link THEN the system SHALL provide quick copy functionality
4. WHEN I search history THEN the system SHALL filter results based on filename or date criteria
5. IF an image was previously uploaded (based on SHA256 checksum) THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate uploads and show existing link

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work entirely offline for configuration and history management, so that my data remains secure and private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL operate entirely locally without external dependencies for core functionality
2. WHEN I store configuration data THEN the system SHALL save it locally using Tauri's secure storage
3. WHEN I access history records THEN the system SHALL retrieve data from local storage only
4. WHEN I export data THEN the system SHALL create local files without cloud dependencies
5. IF network connectivity is required THEN the system SHALL only use it for actual file uploads to configured storage providers

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure proper error handling and user feedback throughout the migration, so that users receive clear information about any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Tauri command fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error information to the frontend
2. WHEN network operations fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with retry options
3. WHEN file operations encounter issues THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details and suggested solutions
4. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic fields and provide correction guidance
5. IF the application encounters unexpected errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging while showing simplified messages to users
