# Task 6: Duplicate Detection and Prevention - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented **source-level duplicate detection and prevention** functionality for the imgtoss application. The system now proactively detects and prevents duplicate image uploads at the point of file selection, rather than allowing duplicates to be uploaded and then managing them afterward.

## Key Improvement: Source-Level Prevention

**Before**: Duplicates were detected after upload, requiring post-processing cleanup.
**After**: Duplicates are detected immediately when files are selected, preventing unnecessary uploads from the source.

This approach:
- ✅ Saves bandwidth and storage costs
- ✅ Improves user experience with immediate feedback
- ✅ Prevents duplicate data from entering the system
- ✅ Reduces server load and processing time

## Implementation Details

### 1. SHA256 Checksum Integration in Tauri Image Service

- Added `calculate_checksum()` method to calculate SHA256 checksums for image files
- Added `calculate_checksum_from_data()` method for calculating checksums from image data
- Integrated sha2 crate for cryptographic hashing
- Implemented async processing for better performance

### 2. Duplicate Detection in History Service

**File: `src-tauri/src/services/history_service.rs`**

- Added `find_duplicate_by_checksum()` method to search for existing images by checksum
- Added `get_duplicates_by_checksum()` method for batch duplicate checking
- Enhanced history records to store checksums in metadata for future duplicate detection

### 3. Tauri Commands for Duplicate Detection

**File: `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs`**

- `calculate_image_checksum`: Calculate SHA256 checksum for an image file

### 5. Source-Level Prevention in Upload Component

**File: `components/kokonutui/image-upload.tsx`**
- **Proactive Detection**: Modified `handleFiles` function to check for duplicates immediately when files are selected
- **Automatic Marking**: Duplicate files are automatically marked with error status and existing URL information  
- **Prevention Logic**: Upload process excludes files marked as duplicates
- **User Feedback**: Immediate alerts inform users about detected duplicates
- **Management Tools**: Added buttons to remove duplicate files or all error files
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear status badges and error messages for duplicate files
- **Simplified UI**: Removed complex duplicate detection workflow in favor of immediate prevention
